used a new round starts with the distribution of other 6 cards from the
 deck.
 
The game ends when no cards remain in the deck.

 his hand and keep taking cards incrementally starting from that number.
 - He can put a card on the table when he can't capture any card.

* The player can also gain points by doing one of this acts:

  * Mesa : when a player takes all the cards on the table (except when 
  it's the final deal and the player is the last one)
